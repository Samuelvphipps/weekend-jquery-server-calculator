# PROJECT NAME
    Weekend Challenge -- Server Calculator
## Description

This is a server calculator that has the server interact with a user interface to complete calculations and the append the solutions to the DOM

The BASE mode took me about four hours, and the stretch up to the app.delete took another 3 hours. This was a fun challenge, and I focused on planning out my data flow before starting. This let me simply adapt my code with some new variables and function operations to fit the stretch goal.

I started using bootstrap at Edan's recommendation and I am still figuring it and base css out. I spent quite a bit of time attempting to fix the bottom row of the calculator and also tried to fix the grid wrapping in the cell phone view. In all, I am happy with the current state but want to learn more about layouts to let me fix these issues.

Thanks to [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality.

Thank you to Edan for introducing me to bootstrap. Although I am still a beginner I am finding it more usable than CSS already.
